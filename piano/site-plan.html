      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will start with displaying the current pianos used today. Then, it will feature a small, brief story of the pianos as well as their mechanisms within each instrument. Will start with the major compenents like pedals and strings that everyone should know to get their attention and then link the history site for further detail in the design mechanisms as well as the change of styles. Will (if we could) include links to official sites that sell pianos for the reader to purchase if they so desire.

      </ul>
      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The second page, "History", will be about the history and development of the piano. This will feature diagrams from the harpsichord all the way to today's pianos, as well as reference images for the reader to visually see the pianos of their time. This page should hopefully answer any questions that relate to the piano's structure as well as their importance in the evolutionary line.

      </ul>
      <h3>Pianos</h3>
      <p>
        The last page will feature a description and image of every piano, as well as others that were not in the evolutionary line but are still considered part of the piano family. This will also include an audio file/clip beneath the image for readers to listen to what the piano's timbre sounded like in its time.
