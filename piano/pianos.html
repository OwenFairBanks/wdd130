                A monochord is a simple musical instrument consisting of just one string stretched over a resonating box or soundboard. It's historically significant as a tool for exploring musical intervals and harmony. Adjusting the string's tension or length demonstrates how vibrations create different pitches, aiding in understanding the relationships between musical tones and mathematical ratios.</p>
